<pre class="text">    It is easy to find. 
    From Melbourne, take the Monash Freeway, connect onto the Eastlink heading for Portsea, then onto the Peninsula link to Sorrento.  
    Another option is the scenic drive around the beach. Although longer, it allows you to experience the coastline from Port Melbourne to Sorrento. 
    If you choose to come across on the Queenscliff/Sorrento Ferry, it is only a 2 minute drive from the Ferry Depot. 
    If you are a foot passenger we are happy to meet you at the Sorrento ferry at. 
    Just phone us on 0435 123 456 as you arrive.</pre>
